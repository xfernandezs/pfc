ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================
 
Ignored Files: 
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* ant.properties 
* build.xml
* cordova\
* cordova\appinfo.jar
* cordova\build.bat
* cordova\clean.bat
* cordova\cordova.bat
* cordova\lib\
* cordova\lib\cordova.js
* cordova\lib\install-device.bat
* cordova\lib\install-emulator.bat
* cordova\lib\list-devices.bat
* cordova\lib\list-emulator-images.bat
* cordova\lib\list-started-emulators.bat
* cordova\lib\start-emulator.bat
* cordova\log.bat
* cordova\run.bat
* cordova\version.bat
* proguard-project.txt

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* assets\ => app\src\main\assets\
* libs\cordova-2.9.0.jar => app\libs\cordova-2.9.0.jar
* libs\Parse-1.3.5.jar => app\libs\Parse-1.3.5.jar
* res\ => app\src\main\res\
* src\ => app\src\main\java\

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
